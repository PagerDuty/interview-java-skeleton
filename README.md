This repository contains Java code snippets for the "API Client Design and Coding" interview slot.

Why? Most applicants struggle with HTTP calls and JSON parsing in Java since they usually rely on a framework.
Each of these snippets can be sent to the applicant in an email once we notice they are struggling.

They are left as example code on purpose to prompt the candidate to make changes and show us their understanding of how HTTP clients work.

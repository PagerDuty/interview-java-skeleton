## Setup

(1) To install an editor, download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx).

(2) Open this folder in VS Code.

(3) Once you open a Java file, it will prompt you to install the Java extension.

(4) Once you did that, it will prompt you to install the JDK if you haven't already.


PS: If you just need the JDK, visit [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot).
